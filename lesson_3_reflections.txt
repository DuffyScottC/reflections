Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I can think of several instances when this would be helpful. If I had a project that I 
wanted to work on both from home and at school, this would be a helpful feature. 
If I were working on a project with multiple people, then I would want to use a remote.


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If git automattically updated every repository, first of all you might have a bunch of test 
branches in your public repository that you maybe did not want there. Second of all, you
would wind up sharing code that you weren't ready to share yet.
