Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I can think of several instances when this would be helpful. If I had a project that I 
wanted to work on both from home and at school, this would be a helpful feature. 
If I were working on a project with multiple people, then I would want to use a remote.


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If git automattically updated every repository, first of all you might have a bunch of test 
branches in your public repository that you maybe did not want there. Second of all, you
would wind up sharing code that you weren't ready to share yet. 

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Forking is specific to git. If you want to make a copy of a repository that someone else
has made, while still linking back to the original repository, use fork. If you just want
to work on an existing repository, use clone to put it on your computer. Branches are for
adding new features without affecting other branches, particularly the master branch.
