Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The only thing that really happens is that it creates a hidden file named .git. 
You now have all you need to start creating commits and branches and things. You can't
do these things without first running git init. 

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area only contains files you intent to commit on your next commit, whereas 
your working directory contains all files at all times. It offers you the ability to
make logical changes per commit, rather than having to force all files to be committed
at once. 

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Once you've added the files you think you want to commit, you can use "git diff --staged"
to see if you are adding the changes you want to be adding.
